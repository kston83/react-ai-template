## Implementation Guidelines

### For Each Feature:
1. **Start with Planning**
   - Define user stories and requirements
   - Create wireframes or reference designs
   - Break down into tasks

2. **Data Layer First**
   - Define types
   - Set up queries and mutations
   - Create mock data for development

3. **Component Development**
   - Build from small to large
   - Create storybook stories (if using storybook)
   - Document props and usage

4. **Testing**
   - Write tests for key functionality
   - Test edge cases
   - Verify accessibility

5. **Integration**
   - Connect to real API
   - Test with realistic data
   - Verify with other features

### Development Flow:
1. Feature branch from `main`
2. Pull request with code review
3. Merge to `development` for integration testing
4. Release to `main` for production

### Definition of Done:
- Feature meets all requirements
- Code passes linting and type checking
- Tests are written and passing
- Documentation is updated
- Accessibility is verified
- Performance is acceptable
- Code is reviewed
